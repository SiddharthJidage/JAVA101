        /* Type Conversion :
         Type conversion is simply the process of converting data of one data type into another.
         This process is known as type conversion, typecasting, or even type coercion.
         There are two more type conversions in Java â€“ implicit and explicit.

         implicit conversions:
         Implicit type conversion, also known as widening casting.
         The order of data types in which implicit type conversion in Java happens is as follows:
         Byte > Short > Char > Int > Long > Float > Double

         explicit conversions:
         Explicit type conversion is the opposite of implicit type conversion. So, instead of widening,
         this type conversion works towards narrowing.
         Syntax: dataType(new) variableName(new)= dataType(new) variableName(old)
         Explicit type conversion in Java works in the following order of conversion:
         Double > Float > Long > Int > Char > Short > Byte

         */

        //implicit type conversions:
        short newNumberOfSeats = numberOfSeats;
        System.out.println("The values of new number of seats:"+ newNumberOfSeats);

        double newFuelConsumptionCombined= fuelConsumptionCombined;
        System.out.println("The values of new fuel consumption combined:"+ newFuelConsumptionCombined + " l/100");


        //explicit type conversion:
        byte newPower = (byte) power;// here newPower is new variableName and power is old variableName. byte is new dataType
        System.out.println("The values of new power:"+ newPower + " kw");
